# FinstagramDB
This is a web application for sharing photos, similar in design to Instagram. 

Users can create an account and within the database they can:

- Follow/Unfollow other accounts
- Share photos with friends, either privately or publicly
- View photo info (i.e. sharer's name, time of post, people tagged, comments/emojis)
- Create friend groups
